                <p>Welcome to the world of Pokémon!<p>
                <p>This is a diary/walkthrough of my experience of my first Nuzlocke. A few hours in, I decided to start a spreadsheet and Google Doc. As my game became more successful, I decided it could be fun to look back on, and maybe share with the world.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="What_is_a_Nuzlocke?">
            <header id="what-is-it?">What is a Nuzlocke?</header>
            <p>Nuzlocke is a way of playing a Pokémon game that is extremely challenging. There are many formats, but there are three basic rules you must follow.
                <ol>
                    <li>You are only allowed to catch the first Pokémon you encounter per area. If it faints or flees, you lose your chance to catch any Pokémon in that area.</li>
                    <li>If your Pokémon faints, it dies. It must be released or stored in the PC permanently.</li>
                    <li>Nickname all of your Pokémon. This is not necessary for completing the challenge, but is part of the fun.</li>
                </ol>
            Your goal is to beat all eight gyms and the Elite Four and become Champion without whiting out. If you white out at any point in the game, your game ends and you must start over.
            </p>

            <p>I decided to do a Nuzlocke because I recently got back into Pokémon and needed a new challenge. I thought the Professor Oak challenge may be too boring for me. Instead of filling up this space with too much text, I've linked my <a href="https://google.com">Google Docs diary</a> for convenience. </p>

            <header id="choosing">Choosing a Game</header>
            <p>Now that you know the rules, you need to choose a game. There are many factors that go into choosing a game and many opinions on what makes a good game to choose, but if you want my opinion, just choose your favorite. I went with LeafGreen, which isn't my favorite. FireRed is, which I replayed recently.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Rules">
            <header id="rules">Rules</header>
            <p>There are some common optional rules as well:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Duplicate Rule: A player may try again if they have already caught the species that appears.
                <span>You may set yourself a limit of attempts to keep it a challenge.</span>
                <li>Shiny Clause: If a player encounters a Shiny, they may try to capture it even if they have already caught a Pokémon in that area. This does not count as an encounter.
                <div class="subtext">
                    <code>1:4096 chance</code>
                </div></li>
                <li>Random Starter: Your starter is chosen based on the last digit of your trainer ID:
                    <div class="subtext">
                        <code>1-3: Grass  |  </code>
                        <code>4-6: Water  |  </code>
                        <code>7-9: Fire  |  </code>
                        <code>0: Player may choose</code>
                    </div>
                </li>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Clauses">
            <header id="clauses">Clauses</header>
            <p>There are some clauses that non-hardcore players apply to make the beginning of the game smoother or for technical gameplay purposes.
                <ul>
                    <li>Diversity Clause: At the start of the game, a player may be allowed to try to catch more than one species of Pokémon in an area as to try to build up a team.</li>
                    <li>Gift Clause: Allows acceptance of in-game trades and given Pokémon, and that a player may be allowed to catch a Pokémon for purposes of an in-game trade.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Use these clauses to your discretion. They are not excuses to cheat.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Other_Versions">
            <header id="other-versions">Other Versions</header>
            <p>There are dozens of other types of Nuzlockes that follow more rules than just the mandatory ones to make the experience more unique and/or challenging. Here are a few examples:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <p class="locke">Wedlocke</p>
                    Pokémon are paired up by gender and can only be swapped out with each other during battle until they are both KO'd. </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="locke">Egglocke</p>
                    Randomly bred and hatched eggs are the only ones able to be used, whether they are bred by the player or sent to them. </li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="locke">Hardcorelocke</p>
                    Items and overlevelling (leveling your team higher than a gym teacher's ace) are not allowed.</li>
                    <li>
                        <p class="locke">Giftlocke</p>
                    A player can only use their starter and gift Pokémon obtained without catching.   
                    </li> 
                </ul>
            <p>These all seemed far too daunting to me and I chose to simply follow the mandatory rules with the Diversity Clause and Gift Clause.</p>
