                <h1>But unlike ever before...</h1>
                <p>This is a diary/walkthrough of my experience of my first Nuzlocke. A few hours in, I decided to start a spreadsheet and Google Doc. As my game became more successful, I decided it could be fun to look back on, and maybe share with the world.</p>

            <header id="what-is-it?">What is a Nuzlocke?</header>
            <p>Nuzlocke is a way of playing a Pokémon game that is extremely challenging. There are many formats, but there are three basic rules you must follow.
                <ol>
                    <li>You are only allowed to catch the first Pokémon you encounter per area. If it faints or flees, you lose your chance to catch any Pokémon in that area.</li>
                    <li>If your Pokémon faints, it dies. It must be released or stored in the PC permanenetly.</li>
                    <li>Nickname all of your Pokémon.</li>
                </ol>
            I'll explain these rules in a later section.  
            </p>

            <p>I decided to do a Nuzlocke because I recently got back into Pokémon and needed a new challenge. I thought the Professor Oak challenge may be too boring for me. Instead of filling up this space with too much text, I've linked my <a href="https://google.com">Google Docs diary</a> for convenience. </p>

            <header id="choosing">Choosing a Game</header>
            <p>Now that you know the rules, you need to choose a game. There are many factors that go into choosing a game and many opinions on what makes a good game to choose, but if you want my opinion, just choose your favorite. I went with LeafGreen, which isn't my favorite. FireRed is, which I replayed recently.</p>

            <header id="rules">Rules</header>
            <p>There are some common optional rules as well.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Duplicate Rule: A player may try again if they have already caught the species that appears.
                <span>You may set yourself a limit of attempts to keep it a challenge.</span>
                <li>Shiny Clause: If a player encounters a Shiny, they may try to capture it even if they have already caught a Pokémon in that area. This does not count as an encounter.</li>
            </li>
            </ul>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Clauses">
            <header id="clauses">Clauses</header>
            <p>There are some clauses that non-hardcore players apply to make the beginning of the game smoother or for technical gameplay purposes.
                <ul>
                    <li>Diversity Clause: At the start of the game, a player may be allowed to try to catch more than one species of Pokémon in an area as to try to build up a team.</li>
                    <li>Gift Clause: Allows acceptance of in-game trades and given Pokémon, and that a player may be allowed to catch a Pokémon for purposes of an in-game trade.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Use these clauses to your discretion. They are not excuses to cheat.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="main-section" id="Other_Versions">
            <header id="other-versions">Other Versions</header>
            <p>There are other types of Nuzlockes that follow more rules than just the mandatory ones, but any Nuzlocke must follow those three. </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wedlocke</li>
                    <li>Itemlocke</li>
                    <li>Typelocke</li>
                    <li>Hardcorelocke</li>
                </ul>
            <p>These all seemed far too daunting to me and I chose to simply follow the mandatory rules with the Diversity Clause and Gift Clause.</p>

            <p>This was my first Nuzlocke. I flew by the seat of my pants. These are solely my opinions!</p>
